# Screw-Heads-Surface-Defects-Classifier
Image analytics-based solution to classify salient surface defects in screw fastener heads.

## Product overview
Surface defects in screw fastener heads pose quality and performance risks. Classifying defects enables for the rapid identification and removal of the causes of their occurrence, as well as the provision of appropriate treatment to fix them. This Deep Learning-based solution identifies two classes of salient surface defects: stripped (worn-out slots) and surface damaged (dents, cracks, etc.) heads. This solution analyses the user-provided image data, identifies the best performing deep learning model architecture, and predicts the defect class with the highest probability score. This can assist fastener manufacturing companies in improving their quality control processes.

## Product Highlight 
* This solution identifies two types of surface defects in screw heads: stripping and surface damage. This solution can assist fastener manufacturing companies in improving their quality control processes.
* This solution analyses flat surface images of screw heads and identifies the best performing deep learning model architecture for defect classification. This solution improves the turnaround time for developing AI-powered visual inspection systems.
* Mphasis DeepInsights is a cloud-based cognitive computing platform that offers data extraction & predictive analytics capabilities. Need Customized Deep learning and Machine Learning Solutions? Get in Touch!
